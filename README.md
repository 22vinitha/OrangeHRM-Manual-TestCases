# OrangeHRM-Manual-TestCases
 This repository contains manual test cases I created for the OrangeHRM application. I prepared and executed test cases for various modules, including Employee, Leave, and Recruitment, covering positive testing, negative testing, and ad-hoc testing. Each test case includes steps, expected results, and actual outcomes.
